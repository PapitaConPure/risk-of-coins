| [`v1.3.1`](https://github.com/PapitaConPure/risk-of-coins/releases/download/v1.3.1/RiskOfCoins.zip) | Recommended for most people. This version addresses some issues and gives clearer feedback for troubleshooting and stuff. |
| [`v1.3.0`](https://github.com/PapitaConPure/risk-of-coins/releases/download/v1.3.0/RiskOfCoins.zip) | This version automatically backups your profiles before applying coins, improves visual clarity, makes the application flow more intuitive, and it's overall easier to use. |
| [`v1.2.0`](https://github.com/PapitaConPure/risk-of-coins/releases/download/v1.2.0/RiskOfOptions.zip) | This version adds Spanish support, only requires you to select the Steam folder (so no "userdata") and to backup your files. Also fixes a few issues. |
| [`v1.1.0`](https://github.com/PapitaConPure/risk-of-coins/releases/download/v1.1.0/RiskOfOptions.zip) | This version lets you select the desired Steam user through a dropdown menu instead of having to specify an ID. It won't work if your Steam isn't on the default path because of a bug fixed on v1.2.0. |
| [`v1.0.2`](https://github.com/PapitaConPure/risk-of-coins/releases/download/v1.0.2/RiskOfOptions.zip) | Latest patch for version 1.0 that has most of the issues with the initial release addressed. This version requires you to specify a Steam User ID along with the Steam "userdata" path. |
| [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/PapitaConPure/risk-of-coins/releases/download/v1.0.0/RiskOfCoins_1_0_0.zip) | Buggiest. Shouldn't be used at all but hey, it's here.                                                                                                       |
